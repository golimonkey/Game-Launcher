# Game-Launcher
A simple and fast game launcher for Windows 7,8,10,11 made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (gdscript). (The program is portable.)

By default the program displays my games, I left them as an example.
To delete my games just delete Shortcuts and PNGs folders inside GameLauncher directory and restart.

To customize the game list (it is very simple) you need to do the folowing:

Drag and drop game shortcuts onto a program.

You can add, remove and rename games with right click context menu and change icons by selecting any .png image for any game.
Games order can be customized by dragging and dropping the icons.

Alternatively you can put your windows shortcuts (hidden extension .lnk) in the "Shortcuts" folder and icons for games/programs 
in the "PNGs" folder and program will add those at startup.
(Icons must have the same name as shortcuts and must also be in .png format.)
Steam generated shortcuts are not classic windows shortcuts with .lnk extension, so they will not work by default (but you can make them work with bat script).
They have extension .url and are in fact "internet shortcuts".

You can search for games if you have large library by just typing the name.
