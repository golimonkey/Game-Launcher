# Game-Launcher
A simple and fast game launcher for Windows 7,8,10,11 made in Godot (gdscript).

Program is portable.

By default program displays my games, I left them as example. 
To customize game list (it is very simple) you need to do the folowing:

Put your shortcuts in a "Shortcuts" folder and icons for games/programs in PNGs folder.
Icons must have the same name as shortcuts and must also be in png format with 256x256 resolution.


Program generates game list from shortcuts and PNGs at startup.
