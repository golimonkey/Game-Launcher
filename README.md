# Game-Launcher
A simple and fast game launcher for Windows 7,8,10,11 made in Godot (gdscript).

The program is portable.

By default the program displays my games, I left them as an example.
To customize the game list (it is very simple) you need to do the folowing:

Drag and drop game shortcuts onto a program.

You can add, remove and rename games with right click context menu and change icons by selecting any .png image for any game.

Alternatively you can put your windows shortcuts (hidden extension .lnk) in the "Shortcuts" folder and icons for games/programs 
in the "PNGs" folder and program will add those at startup.
(Icons must have the same name as shortcuts and must also be in .png format.)

The program generates a game list from shortcuts and PNGs at startup.
