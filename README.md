# Game-Launcher
A simple and fast game launcher for Windows 7,8,10,11 made in Godot (gdscript).

The program is portable.

By default the program displays my games, I left them as an example.
To customize the game list (it is very simple) you need to do the folowing:

Put your shortcuts in the "Shortcuts" folder and icons for games/programs in the "PNGs" folder.
Icons must have the same name as shortcuts and must also be in .png format.
You can also add and remove games with right click context menu and change icons by selecting any .png image.

The program generates a game list from shortcuts and PNGs at startup.
